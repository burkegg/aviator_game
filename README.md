# aviator_game
I wrote this for the Intro to Coding class that I taught. 
My students worked through each part, testing it as they went.
Eventually they integrated all of the parts into a cohesive game.
After this project was over, they created their own object-oriented games.

If you would like to use this for your class, feel free.  You can also use the tutorial videos that go along with it on my website: www.beginningcoding.com

There are also a few modules broken up into separate repos, where code is stubbed for students to fill in.
